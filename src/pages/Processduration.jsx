                         Black Rice Sowing Method
                    </h2>
                    <p className=' pt-1 md:text-lg'>
                         Agricultural scientist Dr. RC Chowdhary says that sowing of Buddha Rice (Kalanamak Rice) crop should be done around June 15.
                         After this transplant after 20 to 25 days. The species of Buddha Rice (Kalanamak Rice) is photosensitive, due to which 12 hours
                         of light days are required for the crop to come into ear. If sowing of Buddha Rice (Kalanamak Rice) crop is done earlier, then the
                         leaves and earrings come out at the scheduled time. Due to which the expenditure of the farmers increases, and
                         there is no special benefit. If the nursery and transplanting of the crop is done on time, then the quality of
                         black rice is good with good aroma. Seeds are planted a year before. Companies provide seeds on the demand letter
                         sent a year ago to the Agriculture Department and other institutions.
